- Fall seven times, stand up eight. Japanese proverb / Every wall is a door. Ralph Waldo Emerson / If you’re not confused, you’re not paying attention. Tom Peters / If you do it for competition you’re screwed. If you do it for love you have a chance. Maxime Lagacé / Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. / Failure is success if we learn from it. Malcolm Forbes / Life is short. Be patient with results and impatient with actions. / You can accomplish lots of things. Commit to ONE and give it your 100%. Then go to the next. /--- You are your worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of engaging in the present. Since nothing seems urgent to you, you're only half involved in what you do. ---/ --- Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert./
-  --- Do not dream or make grand plans for the future, but instead concentrate on becoming proficient at simple and immediate skills./ --- Make creativity rather than comfort your goal and you will ensure far more success for the future./ --- When it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long-term results. And getting the work done in as efficient and creative a manner as possible./--All that should concern you in the early stages of your career is acquiring practical knowledge in the most efficient manner possible./-- To make a discovery, to invent something meaningful that connects with the public, to fashion a work of art that is meaningful, inevitably requires time and effort./--Any kind of resistance or obstacle that crosses your path should be seen as yet another chance to improve your work./-- Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies.
- ---Overcome weakness through sheer persistence./---Withstand the setbacks and failures, the days of drudgery, and the hard work that are always a part of any creative action./--When it comes to your work, be supremely rational and realistic, always looking to improve./--In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. /-- No matter your field, you must think of yourself as a builder, using actual materials and ideas./ Use danger and difficulties as a way to measure your progress./Everything that happens to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.
- --Eventually, the time that was not spent on learning skills will catch up with you, and the fall will be painful./--You must understand the following: In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the field itself and border on the religious. /--The truth is that creative activity is one that involves the entire self - our emotions, our levels of energy, our characters, and our minds. /--Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, and experiencing the power this brings. /--Like an athlete, come to enjoy rigorous practice, pushing past your limits, and resisting the easy way out.
- To create a meaningful work of art or make a discovery or invention requires great discipline, self-control, and emotional stability. / Invent exercises that work upon your weaknesses. / Pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents - will you learn how to focus and move past boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction? / Don't get comfortable. Take risks. Change. Try learning about a field you don't know anything about. Or stepping into a viewpoint you've never considered.
- Resist the lure of easing up on your focus./ In order to learn a subject or skill, particularly one that is complex, we must immerse ourselves in many details, techniques, and procedures that are standard for solving problems./If you are worried about what others might think then you will never really create anything.
- How do you become  better? There is only one  way - The  way  of  discipline - Jocko / Superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience. / Pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents - will you learn how to focus and move past boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction?
- Don't get comfortable. Take risks. Change. Try learning about a field you don't know anything about. Or stepping into a viewpoint you've never considered. / You’ll never know if you don’t TRY. You won’t find success if you never FAIL. Consider this a sign to start going after your dreams. Even if it means failing along the way. You got this. / Chance favors only the prepared mind. / "Keep ignoring feedback and life will keep teaching you the same lesson." / "The brilliance of the stars would be invisible without the vast darkness of space behind them. Do not wish away the difficult portions of life. They provide the contrast needed to appreciate the joyful moments." / "How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days."
- No one is coming. YOU have to make a decision that the next chapter of your life is going to be different. That you’re not going to be unhappy or just get by. YOU have to do the work to change. / Panic disappears after repeated exposure. / When you have success, be extra wary. When you are angry, take no action. When you are fearful, know you are going to exaggerate the dangers you face. /The passive ironic attitude is not cool or romantic, but pathetic and destructive
- You must understand the following: In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the field itself and border on the religious. / No one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you. / No one is coming. YOU have to make a decision that the next chapter of your life is going to be different. That you’re not going to be unhappy or just get by.
YOU have to do the work to change.
"Simple mindset shifts: I'm not hurt, I'm healing.I'm not losing, I'm learning. I was not rejected, I was redirected. Negative things happen. Negative mindsets make them harder." /"Over long time frames, simply staying in the game is impressive. Health and fitness: Can you stay injury free and not miss workouts? Wealth and finance: Can you avoid debt and continue to save? Business: Can you maintain cash flow and stay in business? Longevity is its own form of greatness."
- "Balancing success and failure is a tricky thing.I'd say 8 or 9 times out of 10, you should be succeeding. Build momentum. Accumulate advantages. Feast on the feeling of success and let it feed your desire to do more.But 1 or 2 times out of 10, you should be failing. Push yourself and reach beyond your current grasp. Force yourself to try uncomfortable things. Occasionally you will surprise yourself and the rest of the time you will learn. Win enough to keep progressing. Lose enough to keep learning." / "There can be no happiness if the things we believe in are different from the things we do."
- Say it again:“It feels scary because it’s unfamiliar, not because I’m incapable.” / Once an action becomes automatic, you now have the mental space to observe yourself as you practice. / The great danger is that we give in to feelings of boredom, impatience, fear, and confusion. We stop observing and learning. The process comes to a halt.
- Do not waste time on things you cannot change or influence. Just keep moving. / Move toward resistance and pain.
