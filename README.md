- "The days can be easy if the years are consistent. You can write a book or get in shape or code a piece of software in 30 minutes per day. But the key is you can't miss a bunch of days." / "The wedding is an event, love is a practice. The graduation is an event, education is a practice. The race is an event, fitness is a practice.The heart, mind, and body are endless pursuits."
  
- "Relax. Your rumination, analysis, worry, and need to control the future are robbing you of the current moment. Yes, there is a time for preparation, but continually thinking of the future guarantees you'll never enjoy in the present." / "Exerting more effort doesn't help if you're on the wrong trajectory. Working harder on the wrong thing just wastes more time. Learning more from a biased source will lead you further from the truth. Doubling down on a toxic relationship only sets you up for more headaches. Before you try harder, make sure you are walking a path that leads where you want to go."

- "Two of my rules for life:1. The person who has the most fun wins. 2. The climb is the fun part."/ "Your reputation is your most important asset. It precedes you before you walk into the room and lingers long after the work is done." / "Big wins tend to be accompanied by some combination of bigger decisions, more uncertainty, and greater risk. If you want to play at a higher level, you need to be comfortable with greater swings of highs and lows: mentally, emotionally, financially. You can avoid the swings, but you might be forced to play at a lower level."

- "Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is." / "Arguably the most important skill is controlling your attention. This goes beyond merely avoiding distractions. The deeper skill is finding the highest and best use for your time, given what is important to you. More than anything else, controlling your attention is about being able to figure out what you should be working on and identifying what truly moves the needle."

- "Enough courage to get started + enough sense to focus on something you’re naturally suited for + enough persistence to stay in the game long enough to catch a few lucky breaks + a lot of hard work. There’s your recipe." / "People spend a lot of time talking about other people's bodies, gossiping about other people's relationships, critiquing other people's business, etc. Keep your eyes on your own paper. Work on your body. Nurture your relationships. Improve your business. We all have plenty to improve." / "Many people view their habits and routines as obstacles or, at the very least, obligations to get through. Making the morning coffee, driving your kids to the next activity, preparing the next meal—we often see our routines as chores to be completed.But these are not moments to be dismissed. They are life. Making coffee can be a peaceful ritual—perhaps even a fulfilling one—if done with care rather than rushed to completion. It’s about the amount of attention you devote to these simple moments, and whether you choose to appreciate them or bulldoze through them on the way to the next task. Find the beauty and joy in your daily rituals and you will find beauty and joy in your daily life. To love your habits is to love your days, and to love your days is to love your life." / 

- "People often think that something "far off" will make them happy. That moving to a new place or getting a different job or meeting someone new will change how they feel. But happiness will always be withheld if you believe it is somewhere else. The secret is to find happiness in the people and places that are close to you. See the beauty in the things that are nearby." / "Who does the work? Who bears the consequences? Who reaps the rewards? When the incentives are aligned, it's the same person."

- "Some things work and some things don't. There is almost always another way to get where you want to go. Don't keep trying to open a locked door." / "When nothing is working, explore and make a lot of small bets. After something starts working, double down on what works best. When that stops working, explore and make a lot of small bets again." / "It's not that hard on any given day, but the trick is you can't skip days. Your workouts can be reasonable and still deliver results—if you don't skip days. Your writing sessions can be short and the work will still accumulate—if you don't skip days. As long as you're working, you'll get there."   /  "It's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all."

- 1. Know what you want. 2. Go after it relentlessly." / "You're more likely to unlock a big leap in performance by trying differently than by trying harder. You might be able to work 10% harder, but a different approach might work 10x better. Remain focused on the core problem, but explore a new line of attack. Persistence is not just about effort, but also strategy. Don't merely try harder, try differently." / "First or last? Sometimes the first move is the most important. The first set in the gym. Now you're working out. The first sentence. Now you're writing. The first call. Now you're in the game. Other times, the last move is the most important. The last brick. Now the building is built. The last line of code. Now the app works. The last round of revisions. Now you can ship it. What do you need to focus on right now? First or last? Do you need to start or finish?"

- "Time passes whether I stand still or move." /  "Goals are for people who care about winning once. Systems are for people who care about winning repeatedly." / "Work hard. If results depend on effort, then you will carry yourself far. If results depend on effort and luck, then you will have done what you can to influence the outcome. And if results depend on luck alone, then the outcome is random, but you will have won the battle with yourself." / "One version of confidence is: I've got this figured out. Another version is: I can figure this out.
The first is arrogant and close-minded. The second is humble and open-minded. Be humble about what you know, but confident about what you can learn."

- "Anxiety is thought without control. Flow is control without thought." / "We want solutions, but what we really need are attitudes.
You don't need abs, but rather an attitude of training. You don't need the answer, but rather an attitude of curiosity. You don't need an easier life, but rather an attitude of perseverance. Attitude precedes outcome."

- "Most of the time you don't need more information, you need more courage." / "Avoiding mistakes is an underrated way to improve. It's easier to fend off a bad day than achieve a perfect day. Rather than do your best, avoid your worst." / "Being good at what you do is partially about competence, but not exclusively.Two other things that matter:Reliability. You do what you say you're going to do—on time and as expected.
Enthusiasm. You're excited to be here and eager to work on this problem. Skills matter, but in many cases it's your reliability or attitude that separates you from the pack." / Journalist and author Hunter S Thompson on designing your life: "Beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living within that way of life."

- "Excitement is a better motivator than discipline. The people who appear to have an exceptional work ethic or remarkable discipline are often those with a genuine curiosity or interest in that area. The person who smiles is more likely to keep working than the person gritting their teeth." / "Writing is one of the only ways to outlive yourself. People still read books from hundreds or even thousands of years ago. The author's physical life ended long ago, but their mental life remains alive and meaningful even today." / "The question is not: will today be a good day?Every day is a good day.The question is: how much good will you get out of today?"  / "A talent grows by being used, and withers if it is not used. Closing the gap between expectation and reality can be painful, but it has to be done sooner or later. The fact is that millions of young people would like to write, but what they dream of is the published book, often skipping over the months and years of very hard work necessary to achieve that end..."

- "Curiosity is the beginning of knowledge. Action is the beginning of change." / "Passion is a feeling that follows action. It tends to be created or discovered, not predicted or planned. You don't find your passion. It finds you as you get in the mix and try things." / "Highly focused people do not leave their options open. They select their priorities and are comfortable ignoring the rest. If you commit to nothing, you’ll be distracted by everything." / The Dhammapada, a collection of Buddhist scriptures, on the power of your mind: "What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow. Our life is the creation of our mind." / 

- "Small things matter when they accumulate. This is one of the main lessons of my work—and one of the principles I try to follow in my life. The details, when finely polished and carefully combined, add up to something remarkable." / "Life rewards action, not intelligence. Many brilliant people talk themselves out of getting started, and being smart doesn't help very much without the courage to act. You can't win if you're not in the game." / "Start with the thing you are most motivated to do. Start with a small habit you think is fun and do it consistently. This will not only feel satisfying, but also open your eyes to the type of person you can become. After the first domino falls, you can use the momentum to do a little more."

- Writer and Aikido teacher George Leonard on how to get started: "You can't do everything, but you can do one thing, and then another and another. In terms of energy, it's better to make a wrong choice than none at all. You might begin by listing your priorities—for the day, for the week, for the month, for a lifetime. Start modestly. List everything you want to do today or tomorrow. Set priorities by dividing the items into A, B, and C categories. At the least, accomplish the A items. Try the same thing with long-term goals. Priorities do shift, and you can change them at any time, but simply getting them down in black and white adds clarity to your life, and clarity creates energy."
 
 - "Live the Pareto Principle lifestyle: Relationships. Who are the few people that have the most positive impact on my life? Spend more time with them. Priorities. What are the few actions that have the most positive impact on my day? Prioritize them. Learning. What are the few information sources I learn the most from? Focus on them. Stress. What are the few sources that cause most of the stress and friction in my life? Eliminate them."
 
 - Journalist Flora Rheta Schreiber on starting before you feel ready: "You're never ready for what you have to do. You just do it. That makes you ready." / "The most invisible form of wasted time is doing a good job on an unimportant task." / "It generally feels better to run toward something than to run away from something. Focus on what is pulling you in, not what you're trying to avoid." / "It's easier to notice when you lose money than when you lose time. Be sure you're making the trade you want."
 -  "The myth is that there isn't enough time. There is plenty of time. There isn't enough focus with the time you have. You win by directing your attention toward better things." / "The difference between how I feel before my first set in the gym and how I feel after my first set is enormous. You don't even need a full workout (or work session, etc.) to feel good again. You are 5 minutes away from putting your day on a completely different trajectory." / "The person who focuses on one task and sees it through to completion—even if they work in a somewhat slow or outdated manner—beats the endless optimizer who jumps from tool to tool and always hopes a new piece of technology will help them finish what they start." / "It's hard to remember that this day will never come again. That the time is now and the place is here and that there are no second chances at a single moment."
 
 - "Sometimes all you need for exceptional results is average effort repeated for an above-average amount of time." / "Make your habits fun.This doesn't mean each habit will be the most fun thing in your life, but nearly any habit can be made more fun than it is currently. Ask yourself, "What would it look like if this was fun? What would it look like if meditation or exercise or writing—or whatever—was fun? Find the most enjoyable version of each habit you do." / 
 
- "Whoever has the most fun, wins." /"Time assets vs. Time debts.Time assets are choices that save you time in the future. Think: saying no to a meeting, automating a task, working on something that persists and compounds.Time debts are choices that must be repaid and cost you time in the future. Think: saying yes to a meeting, doing sloppy work that will need to be revised, etc.Time assets are an investment. Time debts are an expense."

- "It's hard to build momentum if you're dividing your attention." / "Many people assume they are bad at writing because it is hard. This is like assuming you are bad at weightlifting because the weight is heavy. / "If you need 10 of something, make 30. Then pick the best."

- "Just because improvements aren't visible doesn't mean they aren't happening. You're not going to see the number change each time you step on the scale. You're not going to finish a chapter each time you sit down to write. Early wins come easy. Lasting wins require a lifestyle." / Writing is useful because it is hard. It's the effort that goes into writing a clear sentence that leads to better thinking." / "One of the most valuable skills in life is being able to see another person's perspective. If you're going to someone's house, think about how it might feel to be the host. If you're creating a product, spend as much time as possible thinking like the customer. If you're calling customer service, think about how it might feel to be on the other end of the conversation. The more clearly you understand the viewpoint of your spouse or customer or coworker, the better positioned you are to find a solution."

- "Focus starts with elimination, improves with concentration, and compounds with continuation." / "Self care takes effort. It doesn’t just happen. The body and mind need to be maintained. Similar to a garden, without effort, weeds will pop up and overtake everything. With a bit of consistent pruning, the results can be beautiful." / "The connective tissue between your failures and your successes is the lessons you learn along the way. It is only by going through your early attempts (usually failures in some form) that you accumulate the insights, skills, and understanding required for success. / Greek philosopher Epicurus on desire and contentment: "Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for." Everything is a lesson. Learn enough lessons and the failures become useful."

- Fall seven times, stand up eight. Japanese proverb / Every wall is a door. Ralph Waldo Emerson / If you’re not confused, you’re not paying attention. Tom Peters / If you do it for competition you’re screwed. If you do it for love you have a chance. Maxime Lagacé / Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. / Failure is success if we learn from it. Malcolm Forbes / Life is short. Be patient with results and impatient with actions. / You can accomplish lots of things. Commit to ONE and give it your 100%. Then go to the next. /--- You are your worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of engaging in the present. Since nothing seems urgent to you, you're only half involved in what you do. ---/ --- Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert./
-  --- Do not dream or make grand plans for the future, but instead concentrate on becoming proficient at simple and immediate skills./ --- Make creativity rather than comfort your goal and you will ensure far more success for the future./ --- When it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long-term results. And getting the work done in as efficient and creative a manner as possible./--All that should concern you in the early stages of your career is acquiring practical knowledge in the most efficient manner possible./-- To make a discovery, to invent something meaningful that connects with the public, to fashion a work of art that is meaningful, inevitably requires time and effort./--Any kind of resistance or obstacle that crosses your path should be seen as yet another chance to improve your work./-- Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies.
- ---Overcome weakness through sheer persistence./---Withstand the setbacks and failures, the days of drudgery, and the hard work that are always a part of any creative action./--When it comes to your work, be supremely rational and realistic, always looking to improve./--In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. /-- No matter your field, you must think of yourself as a builder, using actual materials and ideas./ Use danger and difficulties as a way to measure your progress./Everything that happens to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.
- --Eventually, the time that was not spent on learning skills will catch up with you, and the fall will be painful./--You must understand the following: In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the field itself and border on the religious. /--The truth is that creative activity is one that involves the entire self - our emotions, our levels of energy, our characters, and our minds. /--Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, and experiencing the power this brings. /--Like an athlete, come to enjoy rigorous practice, pushing past your limits, and resisting the easy way out.
- To create a meaningful work of art or make a discovery or invention requires great discipline, self-control, and emotional stability. / Invent exercises that work upon your weaknesses. / Pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents - will you learn how to focus and move past boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction? / Don't get comfortable. Take risks. Change. Try learning about a field you don't know anything about. Or stepping into a viewpoint you've never considered.
- Resist the lure of easing up on your focus./ In order to learn a subject or skill, particularly one that is complex, we must immerse ourselves in many details, techniques, and procedures that are standard for solving problems./If you are worried about what others might think then you will never really create anything.
- How do you become  better? There is only one  way - The  way  of  discipline - Jocko / Superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience. / Pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents - will you learn how to focus and move past boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction?
- Don't get comfortable. Take risks. Change. Try learning about a field you don't know anything about. Or stepping into a viewpoint you've never considered. / You’ll never know if you don’t TRY. You won’t find success if you never FAIL. Consider this a sign to start going after your dreams. Even if it means failing along the way. You got this. / Chance favors only the prepared mind. / "Keep ignoring feedback and life will keep teaching you the same lesson." / "The brilliance of the stars would be invisible without the vast darkness of space behind them. Do not wish away the difficult portions of life. They provide the contrast needed to appreciate the joyful moments." / "How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days."
- No one is coming. YOU have to make a decision that the next chapter of your life is going to be different. That you’re not going to be unhappy or just get by. YOU have to do the work to change. / Panic disappears after repeated exposure. / When you have success, be extra wary. When you are angry, take no action. When you are fearful, know you are going to exaggerate the dangers you face. /The passive ironic attitude is not cool or romantic, but pathetic and destructive
- You must understand the following: In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the field itself and border on the religious. / No one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you. / No one is coming. YOU have to make a decision that the next chapter of your life is going to be different. That you’re not going to be unhappy or just get by.
YOU have to do the work to change.
"Simple mindset shifts: I'm not hurt, I'm healing.I'm not losing, I'm learning. I was not rejected, I was redirected. Negative things happen. Negative mindsets make them harder." /"Over long time frames, simply staying in the game is impressive. Health and fitness: Can you stay injury free and not miss workouts? Wealth and finance: Can you avoid debt and continue to save? Business: Can you maintain cash flow and stay in business? Longevity is its own form of greatness."
- "Balancing success and failure is a tricky thing.I'd say 8 or 9 times out of 10, you should be succeeding. Build momentum. Accumulate advantages. Feast on the feeling of success and let it feed your desire to do more.But 1 or 2 times out of 10, you should be failing. Push yourself and reach beyond your current grasp. Force yourself to try uncomfortable things. Occasionally you will surprise yourself and the rest of the time you will learn. Win enough to keep progressing. Lose enough to keep learning." / "There can be no happiness if the things we believe in are different from the things we do."
- Say it again:“It feels scary because it’s unfamiliar, not because I’m incapable.” / Once an action becomes automatic, you now have the mental space to observe yourself as you practice. / The great danger is that we give in to feelings of boredom, impatience, fear, and confusion. We stop observing and learning. The process comes to a halt.
- Do not waste time on things you cannot change or influence. Just keep moving. / Move toward resistance and pain. / Masters have experienced endless criticisms of their work, doubts about their progress, and setbacks along the way. / Take pleasure in the laborious research process—enjoy the slow cooking of the idea, the organic growth that naturally takes shape over time.
- The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways. / At all costs, avoid entangling yourself emotionally in other people's dramas and battles. / Chance favors only the prepared mind. / "Two competing truths: The more prepared person usually wins. You get credit for action, not preparation." / "What appears to be a rapid shift is often preceded by a gradual process. Our results gradually explode or vanish thanks to the small habits we repeat each day. What radical change are you slowly marching toward? An incremental explosion or an incremental vanishing?"
- "One type of person approaches a situation with the mindset of, “How can I make this work?” Another type seems to approach each circumstance with the mindset of, “What are all the reasons this wouldn’t work?” Both people will be forced to deal with reality, but the first person will only have to solve problems that actually occur while the second person will often avoid taking action entirely because of the potential problems they have dreamt up before starting. There will always be reasons to not do something. Be a problem solver, not a problem adder."
- Masters are those who by nature have suffered to get to where they are. / Intellect is a magnitude of intensity (tension, energy, concentration.), not a magnitude of extensity (Directed towards a quantitative increase, expansion, distribution.). / In dealing with any problem, you must train yourself to look at how it inevitably connects to a larger picture.
- Throughout your life you will encounter tedious situations, and you must cultivate the ability to handle them with discipline. / If we are not careful, our minds become absorbed in endless political intrigues and battles.
- The firmer your grasp on reality, the more power you will have to alter it for your purposes. / Instead of a straight-line development from idea to fruition, the creative process is more like the crooked branching of a tree. / Read more books than those who have a formal education, developing this into a lifelong habit. / Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies.
- Do not take so seriously people's promises or their ardor in wanting to help you. Be prepared for the more frequent change of heart. / It is best to have wide knowledge of your field and other fields, giving your brain more possible associations and connections. / Over time, mastery will come to you.
- You must practice and develop boldness. You will often find uses for it./Each problem or project is different. Hurrying to the end or warming up old ideas will ensure mediocre results. / Scoff at the need for attention and approval—they will lead you astray (Насмехайтесь над потребностью во внимании и одобрении — они уведут вас в заблуждение.).
- Step aggressively towards your fear - that is the  step into bravery / A leader must be humble but not passive, quiet but not silent.(Jocko Willink) / You are not too busy, you are afraid to do the work/ My biggest breakthrough moments happen when I finally  admit that I am tired if my own shit (Mel Robbins)
- "Persistence and variety. These are the two primary ways to develop great ideas or to solve important problems. Keep leaning your head against a topic for a long time. Certainly for weeks, possibly for years. And along the way, try many lines of attack. Continue to generate options, explore paths, and propose silly ideas. Copy and paste concepts from widely different disciplines and see if it gets you anywhere. All the while, continue to refine the best solution you’ve found thus far. What looks like genius may simply be the byproduct of persistence and variety."(James Clear)
- An idea from Atomic Habits: "When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running." (James Clear) / "Good choices create opportunities. Good habits make the most of them."
- "Consistency before intensity. Start small and become the kind of person who shows up every day. Build a new identity. Then increase the intensity." (James Clear) / "Asking what makes someone successful is like asking which ingredient makes a recipe taste good. It’s not any single ingredient. It is the combination of many ingredients in the right proportions and in the right order—and the absence of anything that would ruin the mixture." / "He who angers you, conquers you."
- "The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think." / “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important. ”
– Antoine de Saint-Exupéry / “Always in motion is the future.”– Yoda / “Be stingy with your time and spend it in spaces that fill you up.”- Janet Mock / “All great achievements require time.”– Maya Angelou
- "Some things are a job, others are a craft. The primary difference is not the task, but the enthusiasm and curiosity put into the task. The more engaged and interested you are, the more it becomes a craft." / "It only takes five minutes to break the cycle. Five minutes of exercise and you are back on the path. Five minutes of writing and the manuscript is moving forward again. Five minutes of conversation and the relationship is restored. It doesn't take much to feel good again." / "Nobody accomplishes anything significant alone. But nobody accomplishes anything significant by accident either. Just because you need others doesn't mean you can wait for others to make it happen. You have to act as if you are a force of nature and try to bend the universe in your desired direction—while remaining pleasant and open to help along the way."
- "A mindset that can take you far in life: What I want doesn't exist, so I'll create it." / "You don’t always get to choose the load, but you can choose how to carry it." / "If you want to create something but feel it has already been done 1000 times, remember: There is always room for quality." 
- "Deconstruct the cool things you see.If you'd like to become a better musician and you see an amazing performance, start paying attention to how they do it. How did they promote the event? What happens in the first ten seconds of each song? How frequently are they engaging directly with the audience? Is there a progression of energy throughout the show? When something fascinates you, pay attention to the details. The person who thinks, "That was cool" is a consumer. The person who thinks, "How did they make something that cool?" is on the path to being a creator. Don't just taste the recipe, look for the ingredients."
- Philosopher and author Albert Camus on resilience: "In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer." / "You just need to have the courage to eliminate everything that doesn't directly feed what you really want." / "Risk is an essential need of the soul. The absence of risk produces a kind of boredom which paralyses in a different way from fear, but almost as much."
- "It is nearly impossible to have your best idea the first time you think about something. The most likely way to uncover important insights is to frequently revisit a problem. The longer you're in the game, the more ideas bubble up to the surface. Time unlocks insights." / An idea from Atomic Habits: "Happiness is simply the absence of desire... Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state."
- "10-year dreams. 5-minute actions. Where do I want to be in 10 years? What can I do in the next 5 minutes to contribute to that outcome?" / "Anyone can listen. All you have to do is stop talking.But to be a good listener, you have to stop talking and be interested. Genuine curiosity is the precursor to understanding, and a good listener helps the other person feel understood." / "You can graduate with the finest degrees. You can read the most useful books. You can enjoy the loving support of family and friends. But your degrees can't take action for you. Your books can't make the decision for you. Your family can't live your life for you. There is no substitute for courage. At some point, you have to make the choice." / Author Patricia Digh on the New Year: "At the end of each year, I ask myself two questions: 1) What do I want to create in this New Year? And, perhaps even more importantly, 2) What do I want to let go of?"
- "You have to show up before inspiration will." / "Just start. Start slow if you have to. Start small if you have to. Start privately if you have to.Just start." / A reminder from Atomic Habits as we start the new year: "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity." / "Action is hope. At the end of each day, when you’ve done your work, you lie there and think, Well, I’ll be damned, I did this today. It doesn’t matter how good it is, or how bad—you did it. At the end of the week you’ll have a certain amount of accumulation. At the end of a year, you look back and say, I’ll be damned, it’s been a good year." / Steve Jobs on the intersection of thinking and doing:"My observation is that the doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker and doer in one person. And if we really go back and we examine, you know, did Leonardo have a guy off to the side that was thinking five years out in the future what he would paint or the technology he would use to paint it? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result. And there is no difference in our industry. The people that have really made the contributions have been the thinkers and the doers."
- "The hard way is the fast way. Do it right the first time and you won't have to do it over the next time." / "The responsibility of any creator is to do the work, not judge it. Your job is to fall in love with the process, not grade the outcome." / "The more time you spend complaining about what you deserve, the less time you have to focus on what you can create. Focus on what you can control."
- "If you never question things, your life ends up being limited by other people's imaginations. Take the time to think and dream, to question and reconsider. It is better to be limited by what you can dream for yourself than by where you fit in someone else's dream." / "The edge is in the inputs. The person who consumes from better sources, gets better thoughts. The person who asks better questions, gets better answers. The person who builds better habits, gets better results. It's not the outcomes. It's the inputs." / "May I be the tiniest nail in the house of the universe, tiny but useful."
- "You'll feel better once you get started." / "Do one thing per day that compounds." / "The ability to love yourself improves your ability to be loved. We are unlikely to accept a relationship that is worse than the one we have with ourselves, and thus the person who is happy and comfortable with themselves is in a great position. The person with healthy self-esteem doesn't have to jump into any relationship because they already have a great one wherever they go." / Writer Sarah Perry on how to build an exercise habit you actually enjoy (or any habit, really): "Unfortunately, most on-ramps to exercise are at an intensity too high for previously-sedentary people to find them pleasurable. If people go to a fitness class, or focus on running a particular distance at a particular speed, they’ll likely miss the pleasure zone entirely. Refocusing on exercising only for one’s own individual pleasure, as slowly as one prefers, and only at intensities that are pleasurable, is more likely to motivate repeat and habitual exercising. At that point, the enjoyment of exercise pleasure can build on itself, motivating longer and longer intervals of experiencing the pleasure."
- "The world seems to be accustomed to delaying gratification less and less, which means the rewards of delaying gratification grow more and more." /"The more an idea is tied to your identity, the more you will ignore evidence it is false. To continue to grow and learn, you must be willing to update, expand, and edit your identity."
- "It doesn't make sense to continue wanting something if you're not willing to do what it takes to get it. If you don't want to live the lifestyle, then release yourself from the desire. To crave the result but not the process, is to guarantee disappointment." / "Finish something. Anything. Stop researching, planning, and preparing to do the work and just do the work. It doesn’t matter how good or how bad it is. You don’t need to set the world on fire with your first try. You just need to prove to yourself that you have what it takes to produce something. There are no artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists who became great by half-finishing their work. Stop debating what you should make and just make something."
- "Before you throw more time at the problem, throw more focused action at the problem. You don’t need more time, you need fewer distractions." / "Patience only works if you do. Doing the work + patience = results. Planning to work + patience = you're just waiting." / "Momentum goes both ways.Don’t move, feel sluggish. Start moving, feel like moving a little more. Don't talk, feel timid. Start chatting, conversation gets a little easier. Don't ship, feel stuck. Start creating, ideas begin to flow."
- Mountaineer Alex Lowe on how to be the best: "The best climber in the world is the one who's having the most fun." / "Inspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists. There is, there has been, there will always be a certain group of people whom inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination. It may include doctors, teachers, gardeners — I could list a hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous adventure as long as they manage to keep discovering new challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem that they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous I don't know."
- "The 2-step process for exceptional results:(1) Spend a little time each day thinking about the highest leverage activity available to you. (2) Spend a little time each day working on it."
- "With the creative process, the key is to create a lot and edit a lot. Make more than you need, then remove everything that isn't exceptional."
- "What you do on your ordinary days determines what you can achieve on your extraordinary days." / Novelist Paulo Coelho on taking action: "One day you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to do the things you’ve always wanted. Do it now." / Is it better to delay getting started by weeks or months so I can be fully prepared? Or is it better to start right now with little to no preparation?
- "When you need to learn quickly, learn from others. When you need to learn deeply, learn from experience." / "If two people have the same goal, you know nothing about the similarity of their results. But if two people have the same daily habits, you can infer quite a bit about the similarity of their results. Your results are largely a byproduct of your habits." / "A paradox of life is that the greatest returns come in the long-term, but the opportunity cost of moving slowly is huge. Long-term thinking is not slow acting. Act fast on things that compound. Never let a day pass without doing something that will benefit you in a decade."
- "It's rarely doing the work that is hard, it's starting the work. Once you begin, it’s often less painful to continue working. This is why—in the beginning—it is often more important to build the habit of getting started than it is to worry about whether or not you are doing enough." / "Imagine the outcome you want to create.Envision where you are headed in great detail. Don't talk yourself out of it. Don't encourage yourself to be realistic. You will have to wrestle with reality soon enough. Don't be your own bottleneck at this stage. What would the magical outcome be?"
- "Don't rush, but don't wait. Act with urgency, but release yourself from the need to achieve it on a particular timeline. When you think longer term than most, you can think bigger than most. If it takes years, start now."
- "Your problems adjust to their true level of importance after a hard workout and a good night of sleep." / "If you want to be rich, then be kind.It’s hard to create wealth unless you work well with others, and it's hard to work well with others if you are unlikable. Even if you can build wealth without kindness, rich jerks end up poor in friendship. You can buy friends, but not good ones." / "Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own."
